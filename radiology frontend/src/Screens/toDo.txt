Request:
1) After doc performs annotations gotta ensure size of json object aint past 16MB.



---------
Question:
-> For efficiency after the ai engineer downloads the files, can they be removed from the DB.
->

---------
To do:
1) Admin: 3 tables, one with doc details and the other 2 are for icom series that are messed with(json file and dcm series) and not messed with (dcm series)
--Admin should be able to upload a dicom series from their own local storage.
-- The dicom series that are messed with or not messed with should have a general name given by frontend but the admin must have an option to change that name.
2)Doctor: done but can be improved like
- Doctors must be able to either upload their own dicom series or get the one sent to them.
- Make sure that the dicom shower works for dicom images of any dimensions.
3) AI: a table with finished annotations and they can download both the dcm folder and json.



- Admin uploads dcm folder to a specific Doctor
    - An upload button in each row of the doctors table for each doctor
    - After upload is done it should be updated dynamically in the table where "not messed with" dicom files are kept
- Doctor gets a notification that he got a job to do, performs annotations and saves
- Saved shit (json file, dicom folder) is stored #TODO somewhere, then the third table (messed with) is updated and the AI tools engineer can download it
